# Scalar Waze Boundary (Math vs Interpretation)

**Status:** Enforced via CI boundary gate  
**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

## Mathematical Substrate Notice (Non-Negotiable)

The Gaussian explicit formula, its zero spectrum, and its prime-side expansion are **classical results in analytic number theory**.

We do **not** modify, extend, or claim ownership over these results. All number-theoretic statements remain standard and unchanged.

---

## Definition: Scalar Waze

**Scalar Waze** refers to the use of the classical Gaussian explicit formula as a **bidirectional analytic map** between zero spectra and prime power contributions, parameterized by a smoothing scale.

Nothing more. Nothing less.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

Scalar Waze is:

- ❌ **NOT** a physical theory
- ❌ **NOT** a model of consciousness
- ❌ **NOT** a new zeta framework
- ❌ **NOT** a proof strategy for RH
- ❌ **NOT** a modification of classical results

It is a **routing lens**, not an ontology.

---

## Boundary Rule (Hard Line)

**Scalar Waze stops at:** *"This identity holds."*

Any work beyond this point **must** be labeled as interpretation/constraint-layer content.

---

## Constraint-Layer Mapping (FHCM / Coherence Framing)

This layer does **not** change the math. It introduces **optional constraints** on how one may interpret the spectrum.

| Classical Object | Mathematical Role | Constraint-Layer Role |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Zeros γ          | Spectral points   | Stability candidates |
| Primes p         | Generators        | Discrete drivers     |
| Gaussian σ       | Test function     | Bandwidth parameter  |
| Critical line    | Symmetry locus    | Stability condition  |

---

## Permitted Conditional Claim (Maximal Defensible Form)

> **If** one treats the explicit formula as a stability-constrained field relation, **then** spectral mass away from the critical line corresponds to instability under Gaussian bandwidth refinement.

**Properties of this claim:**
- Conditional ("if")
- Test-function dependent
- **Not** a theorem
- **Not** a proof
- **Not** physics

It lives entirely in **interpretive analysis**, not number theory.

## Integration with DNA Ledger Vault

This separation allows clean layering:

- **Scalar Waze** → Analysis tool (classical math)
- **FHCM** → Interpretive framework (optional)
- **GeoPhase** → Engineering system (constrained)
- **RFC6979 / Ethereum** → Cryptographic enforcement (auditable)

**No layer depends on belief in the layer above it.**

This is critical for audit, legal review, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

---

## Enforcement

This boundary is enforced via:

1. **Documentation:** This file + `NON_CLAIMS.md` + `CLAIMS_REGISTER.md`
2. **Code gate:** `tools/check_boundaries.py`
3. **CI workflow:** `.github/workflows/boundary_gate.yml`
4. **Make target:** `make boundary`

Any PR that violates these boundaries will fail CI.

**Status:** ✅ Boundary enforced  
**Philosophy:** Open rules. Closed engines. Auditable guarantees.
